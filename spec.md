> Placeholder Policy: Internal hosts are intentionally represented as `<CASATUNES_HOST>` or `<YOUR-CASA-IP>` to avoid leaking private infrastructure details.

## üìù Casatunes API Documentation and Base URL

- The Casatunes API documentation is available at: `http://<CASATUNES_HOST>/casadev/API.aspx`
- **Important:** All actual API calls from the UI must use the base URL pattern: `http://<CASATUNES_HOST>:8735/api/v1`
- Replace `<CASATUNES_HOST>` with the hostname or IP of your Casatunes server (kept as a placeholder here to avoid publishing internal LAN IPs). The app requires this to be provided at build time via `REACT_APP_API_BASE`.

### Example (Group/Share Rooms):
- To group/share music from one zone to another, use:
  - `POST http://<CASATUNES_HOST>:8735/api/v1/zones/{zoneId}/share/{targetZoneId}`
  - Both `zoneId` and `targetZoneId` can be a ZoneID, Zone Name, or Persistent ZoneID.

# Spec template

## üóÇ 1. Overview
- **Name**: Casatunes Alternate User Interface
- **Summary**: A web-based UI that provides a completely unique interface for controlling Casatunes, leveraging the Casatunes API stack.
- **Primary Goal**: Enable household members to control Casatunes through a custom, user-friendly web interface.
- **Key Outcomes**:
  - 100% unique UI distinct from the default Casatunes interface
  - Seamless integration with Casatunes API
  - Intuitive controls for all household users

---

## üõ† 2. Capabilities & Use Cases
  - Show a play progress bar for the current song in the selected room, updating in real time.
  - The app must refresh and stay aware when a song changes (e.g., update UI when track changes automatically).
- **Core Capabilities**:

  - Display a list of all available rooms for control
  - Select a room to control (dropdown, no extra header, selected room is highlighted only in dropdown)
  - Show any room that is currently on
  - Basic media controls: play/pause toggle (single button), skip
  - Play/pause toggle button: If the room is playing, show the "pause" icon; clicking it sends the "pause" command and switches to the "play" icon. If the room is paused, show the "play" icon; clicking it sends the "play" command and switches to the "pause" icon. The icon updates optimistically for responsiveness.
  - Album art: Display album art above the controls for the selected room, if available from the API. Album art should be a square and not cropped.
  - Song title: Always display the full song title. If it is too long to fit, use a horizontal scrolling marquee effect.
  - Album title: Display on a single line, truncate with ellipsis if too long.
  - Artist: Display centered under the song title.
  - All Now Playing text (title, artist, album) should be centered in the UI.
  - Error logging: All API errors are logged and visible in a log viewer in the UI.
  - Room selection: Use a dropdown for room selection, with a colored icon indicating power state.
  - All controls (power, play/pause, skip, volume) are directly wired to the Casatunes API endpoints.
  - UI state refresh: The UI refreshes state after each action to stay in sync with the backend.
  - Control and display volume for each room
  - Turn on a room
  - Add rooms to a room group for synchronized playback
  - Display song length and current playback position
  - Show album art, artist, and song information
  - "All Off" button to turn off all rooms

## üñ•Ô∏è 2a. UI/UX Implementation Notes
- The default selected room is "office" on initial load.
- The room selector dropdown should not have a header or extra text; only the dropdown is visible.
- The selected room is only highlighted in the dropdown, not displayed elsewhere.
- Album art is always square (1:1 aspect ratio) and centered.
- Song title uses a marquee effect if too long to fit; album title is always single-line with ellipsis.
- All Now Playing text is centered.

- **Primary Behaviors / Use Cases**:
  - As a user, I want to see all available rooms so that I can choose which one to control.
  - As a user, I want to see which rooms are currently on so that I know what is active.
  - As a user, I want to control playback (play, pause, skip) in a selected room so that I can manage music easily.
  - As a user, I want to control the volume and see the current volume for each room so that I can adjust sound levels as needed.
  - As a user, I want to turn on a room so that I can start music in that space.
  - As a user, I want to group rooms together so that music plays in multiple rooms at once.
  - As a user, I want to see the song's progress and details so that I know what's playing.
  - As a user, I want to turn off all rooms with a single action for convenience.

## üåê 3. Interfaces & Entry Points
- **Interfaces Provided**:
  - Web interface (browser-based UI)
- **Protocols/Formats**:
  - JSON (for all API communication)
- **Auth Model**:
  - None (no authentication required for UI or API)

---

## üßÆ 4. Data & Storage
- **Input Data**:
  - All state and control data is accessed from the Casatunes API; no local data is required.
- **Output Expectations**:
  - UI displays real-time data from the Casatunes API; no data is persisted by the UI.
- **Storage Mechanism**:
  - No storage required; all state is managed by the Casatunes server.
- **Retention & Lifecycle**:
  - Not applicable; no data is stored by the UI.

---

## üîó 5. Dependencies & Integrations
- **Outbound Dependencies**:
  - Casatunes API (for all control and state operations)
- **Inbound Triggers/Events**:
  - None; all interactions are initiated by the UI.
- **Rate Limits / Retries / Idempotency**:
  - No special requirements or concerns at this time.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 6. Runtime & Concurrency
- **Language/Environment**:
  - Web application; React with Material UI recommended for a modern, polished look and large community support. (Python can be used for backend/API proxy if needed, but frontend will use JavaScript/TypeScript.)
- **Concurrency Model**:
  - Single user, single session; minimal concurrency concerns. UI may make multiple async API calls as needed.
- **State Handling**:
  - Stateless; all state is managed by the Casatunes API, with no persistent state in the UI.

---

## üßë‚Äçüîß 7. Operational Characteristics
- **Performance Targets**:
  - UI should be lightweight, snappy, and modern in appearance; no strict latency or throughput requirements.
- **Resilience & Failure Modes**:
  - No special resilience needs; if the UI or API fails, user can simply reload the page.
- **Observability Requirements**:
  - No logging, metrics, or tracing required at this time.
- **UI Platform Focus**:
  - Desktop browser focus for initial release; mobile and tablet support may be considered in the future.
- **Accessibility/Internationalization**:
  - No requirements for accessibility or internationalization at this time.
- **UI Toolkit**:
  - Material UI (MUI) for React to provide a polished, modern look out-of-the-box.
- **Drag-and-Drop**:
  - No drag-and-drop UI builder required; code-based UI development preferred.

---

## üîí 8. Security & Privacy
- **Threat Surface**:
  - No secrets or sensitive data; API is completely open.
- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - No authentication or authorization required.
- **Encryption & Secret Mgmt**:
  - No special encryption or secret management needs.

---

## üß™ 9. Testing & Validation
- **Test Types**:
  - Manual testing for initial development; automated/unit testing can be added later as needed.
- **Validation Rules**:
  - None specified at this time.
- **Synthetic or Generated Data Strategies**:
  - Not required for initial development.

---

## üì¶ 10. Packaging & Deployment
- **Delivery Targets**:
  - Docker container (as lightweight as possible, e.g., using Alpine base image)
- **Deployment Targets**:
  - Homelab Docker server (<YOUR_DOCKER_HOST>)
  - Local Docker Desktop for testing
- **CI/CD Needs**:
  - To be added later; initial deployments will be manual.

---
